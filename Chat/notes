Port of Openfire to dalvik.

To run:
 - compilation of android has to be at the paths indicated in openfire_bin/dalvik
 - run openfire_bin/run.sh
 - currently (openfire_bin/target/openfire/conf/openfire.xml) uses the embedded hsqldb
   the folder embedded-db contains the scripts used by the embedded hsqldb database;
   users aaasz and usera are in the database. Information about the room is temporary,
   it's kept in server memory and discarded once the last user disconnected (I think
   this is specified by the xmpp specification)

- admin console has been disabled 

- ported/replaced libraries:
    - bouncycastle2.jar (replaces bcpg-jdk15on.jar, bcpkix-jdk15on and bcprov-jdk15on.jar)
    - xmpp.jar
    - removed all mina dependencies
    - replaced xpp3 (I think with bouncycastle2.jar)
    - ported digestmd5 server
